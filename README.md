# random_password_generator
This is a project for my front-end developer bootcamp.
I had to write a random password generator using a starter code.
I had to follow the instructions below:
The application must:
Generate a password when the button is clicked.
Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
Length of password:
At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
Character types:
Lowercase
Uppercase
Numeric
Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)
Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
